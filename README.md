# Terminal_Chess
My attempt at creating a version of chess that can be played within a terminal.

There is much more that should be added to this at some point, including a logic/engine file,
but there is other stuff needs to be figured out first. Even at this point, I am not sure I need
a pieces file, but they'll get ironed out.

In the meantime, please be nice and wait paitently.
